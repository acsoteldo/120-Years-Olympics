# 120-Years-Olympics
Analysing Trends, Participation Metrics, and Future Considerations

## Feedback for Final Project
Great work on your presentation! I was impressed by your use of Excel for data cleaning, especially in identifying and removing outliers like submissions from deceased individuals. Your research on specific tables and data exploration was thorough and well-executed.

The use of Tableau for visualization, particularly with the addition of pages and year-over-year comparisons based on prior Olympics, was smart and organized. Your knowledge of the data and inclusion of background information greatly enhanced understanding.

Your thoughtful choices in selecting years for analysis, considering factors like war, GDP, and country status, were commendable. Your ability to articulate how these considerations could affect or skew the data showed a high level of analytical acumen.

For future presentations, it would be interesting to explore changes in female-dominated sports over time. Additionally, addressing the challenge of identifying the bottom 5 could be improved by grouping years for this data point.

Overall, I appreciate how you consistently highlighted considerations throughout the presentation, enriching our understanding of the analysis. Keep up the excellent work!
