# 120 Years of Olympics History
Analysing Trends, Participation Metrics, and Future Considerations

## Getting Started: 
1. Report and presentation
2. data/: Contains cleaned datasets used for the analysis
4. visualizations/: Tableau visualizations and dashboard

### Tools:
Excel, SQL, Tableau

### Data Sources:
This is a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. This data was scraped from www.sports-reference.com in May 2018.

The analysis will be based on the cleaned dataset, which includes the following fields:
* ID: Unique number for each athlete
* Name: Athlete's name
* Sex: M or F
* Age: Integer
* Height: In centimeters
* Weight: In kilograms
* Team: Team name
* NOC: National Olympic Committee 3-letter code
* Games: Year and season
* Year: Integer
* Season: Summer or Winter
* City: Host city
* Sport: Sport
* Event: Event
* Medal: Gold, Silver, Bronze, or NA
  
## Problem Definition
With Paris 2024 and LA 2028 on the horizon, the Olympic Committee should aim to enhance female participation.

## Hypothesis
A higher presence of successful female athletes from a country positively impacts the participation of women from that country in the Olympics.

## Vision
An Olympics where women's participation is celebrated and encouraged at all levels.

## Objective
Increase women's participation and representation across all Olympic events.
OUR ASK: IDENTIFY PRIME LOCATIONS THAT OPTIMIZE WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION THROUGHOUT THE OLYMPICS

## Key Insights
* If a country is young in its chronological age, then it is notable that winning a medal at this point may have counted for another country in the past.
* Kosovo has one medal, as of 1990, but was previously considered part of Serbia.
* War impacts how people are able to compete for their birth country.

## Next Steps
* Utilize historical data to forecast participation trends for Paris 2024 and LA 2028.
* Analyze the correlation between unique uniform designs and athletic success.
* Determine the relationship of financial investments in Olympic teams and athletic performance.
* Explore the correlation between a country's economic indicators (GDP, population size, etc.) and its success in the Olympics.
* Targeted talent development for promising female athletes.
* Partnerships and sponsorships committed to promoting gender equality in sports.

## Feedback for Final Project
Great work on your presentation! I was impressed by your use of Excel for data cleaning, especially in identifying and removing outliers like submissions from deceased individuals. Your research on specific tables and data exploration was thorough and well-executed.

The use of Tableau for visualization, particularly with the addition of pages and year-over-year comparisons based on prior Olympics, was smart and organized. Your knowledge of the data and inclusion of background information greatly enhanced understanding.

Your thoughtful choices in selecting years for analysis, considering factors like war, GDP, and country status, were commendable. Your ability to articulate how these considerations could affect or skew the data showed a high level of analytical acumen.

For future presentations, it would be interesting to explore changes in female-dominated sports over time. Additionally, addressing the challenge of identifying the bottom 5 could be improved by grouping years for this data point.

Overall, I appreciate how you consistently highlighted considerations throughout the presentation, enriching our understanding of the analysis. Keep up the excellent work!
